# TODO
- Train at least one for sign shape (diamond, rectangle, round, triangle, etc.)
- Train at least one for sign type (stop, speed, warning, parking, etc.)
- Create a 5 pages (max) report
  - Machine learning algorithms that you considered
  - Why you selected these approaches
  - Evaluations of the performance of trained model(s)
  - Your ultimate judgement with supporting analysis and evidence

## Model options
A bunch of different neural network designs probably:
- Some with different arrangements of convolutional layers/kernals/etc.
- Some with translations/scaling to prevent overfitting
