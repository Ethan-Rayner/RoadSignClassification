    "## Performance Metric\n",
    "Due to the large class imbalance (as seen above), accuracy does not make for a good performance metric, as the model could completely ignore stop signs and still perform quite well. A good alternative for accuracy is the F1-Score. F1-Scores are calculated for each class independently, using formulas based on the number of true positives, false positives and false negatives, the overall F1-Score is the mean of the F1-Scores for each class. This means each class has equal weighting, so a model that does poorly on stop signs will incur the same penalty as one that does poorly on warning signs. "

    "ImageDataGenerators are used to generate training and validation images that aren't always identical to the originals in the `images/` directory. A series of random translations, scaling, rotations and brightness shifts are applied to the images first. This ensures that as the model trains during the numerous epochs, it is seeing somewhat fresh data not repeated information that it could overfit to."
